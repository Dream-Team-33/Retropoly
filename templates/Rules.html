        <h1>Rules</h1>
              <p>
                Each player takes it in turns to select a card they want to develop and move it into the to-do list, 
                this will highlight the card on the Kanban board, and roll the on screen dice. 
                The number rolled is then deducted from the cards remaining hours. 
                Each player gets 3 rolls per turn if the card hits 0 then it is moved into the completed section of the Kanban board. <br>
                At the end of the players turn a challenge card may appear this challenge card has a question related to scrum and agile development. 
                If the player gets the question correct then a set number of hours will be deducted from the card they were working on. <br><br>

                After each player has taken a turn that is the end of the first sprint. 
                The game has a set number of sprints which is 4. 
                After the first sprint the team is presented with cards that each team member needs to fill out.
                These cards are either Keep doing, doing better and Stop doing. <br><br>

                <h5><b><i>Cards:</i></b></h5>
                
                <b>Keep doing - </b>This card will be where the player will say something they
                 think the team is doing the best and should keep on doing in order to progress the most in the game.<br><br> 

                <b>Doing better – </b>This is where the player puts in what they think 
                the team could be doing better at in order to make the most progression in the game.<br><br>
                
                <b>Stop doing –</b>This is where the players can voice their opinion 
                on something they think the team are doing wrong and they need to stop doing.<br><br><br><br>

                After each player has entered 1 of each card and selected the next set of cards to move into the to-do list the next sprint begins. 

                After each players turn on this sprint including a challenge card appearing so to does either a keep doing, doing better or a stop doing card. 
                The team is then able to have a discussion on what the card is about. <br><br>

                For keep doing cards this allows the team to talk about why what is on the card is working and to agree to keep doing it. 

                For Doing better cards this allows the team to talk about ways they can improve on what is on the card and make a plan to improve. 

                For Stop doing cards this allows the players to discuss why a certain player thinks what they are doing 
                needs to stop and also allows the team to see why certain behaviours are not good in relation to scrum/agile development. <br><br>

                The game then continues along this track until the total number of sprints has been reached or until all story points are completed. 

                Throughout the game their will be teaching points that come up. 
                These teaching points will either explain the game and 
                its features to players and also will have lessons on scrum development, agile development and Kanban boards.
