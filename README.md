# Retropoly (BETA)
__SOC09109 - Group Project__

This project is in a BETA version.

## Description of Game
The aim is to teach players scrum development with the use of a Kanban board which will be used as a story telling device and teaching points throughout the game. Retropoly also allows the players to have discussions throughout the game in relation to their own progress as a team. They will discuss what is going well, what needs improvement and what they need to stop doing. This means that the team can change their approach from sprint to sprint taking on-board lessons learned and progressing the story scenario.
